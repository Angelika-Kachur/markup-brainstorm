//Sass @each directive loops over each item in a list or map.
//On each iteration, the variable gets assigned to
//the current value from the list or map.

@each $color in blue, red, green {
  .#{$color}-text {
    color: $color;
  }
}

//A map has slightly different syntax

$colors: (
  color1: blue,
  color2: red,
  color3: green
);

@each $key, $color in $colors {
  .#{$color}-text {
    color: $color;
  }
}

//Note that the $key variable is needed to reference the keys in the map.
//Otherwise, the compiled CSS would have color1, color2... in it.

//Both of the above code examples are converted into the following CSS:

.blue-text {
  color: blue;
}

.red-text {
  color: red;
}

.green-text {
  color: green;
}
